# Naming Themes for GBE Components

Thematic naming for system components. Each theme maps the same set of roles
to a different sci-fi aesthetic. The active theme affects binary names, log
prefixes, config sections, and CLI output.

## Active: Forerunner (Ancient AI Hierarchy)

Inspired by autonomous AI constructs guarding vast infrastructure.

| Role | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Nexus** | Bus / transport layer | Central nervous system, message backbone |
| **Sentinel** | Per-host VM lifecycle manager | Guards the host, enforces boundaries |
| **Watcher** | Sweeper / archiver | Passive monitor, detects anomalies, cleans up |
| **Oracle** | Task router / scheduler | Makes routing decisions, distributes work |
| **Overseer** | Human command interface | Observer with intervention authority |
| **Operative** | Guest agent inside VM | Executes the mission, reports back |
| **Beacon** | Heartbeat / health signals | Periodic proof-of-life broadcast |
| **Custodian** | Image / artifact manager | Maintains rootfs images, kernels, manifests |
| **Architect** | System provisioner / deployer | Stands up new hosts, configures infrastructure |
| **Envoy** | Cross-cluster bridge | Relays between isolated network zones |

## Theme: Colony Ship (Station Crew)

A self-sustaining station where every role keeps the ship running.
Expanse / Alien aesthetic.

| Role | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Relay** | Bus / transport layer | Comms backbone between decks |
| **Sentinel** | Per-host VM lifecycle manager | Station security, compartment control |
| **Salvager** | Sweeper / archiver | Reclaims resources, scraps dead processes |
| **Marshal** | Task router / scheduler | Assigns crew to jobs |
| **Overseer** | Human command interface | Bridge officer with override authority |
| **Drone** | Guest agent inside VM | Expendable worker unit |
| **Pulse** | Heartbeat / health signals | Life-sign monitor |
| **Quartermaster** | Image / artifact manager | Manages supplies and provisions |
| **Shipwright** | System provisioner / deployer | Builds and repairs infrastructure |
| **Courier** | Cross-cluster bridge | Runs messages between ships |

## Theme: Defense Grid (Autonomous Network)

A distributed defense network protecting a perimeter.
Horizon Zero Dawn / Mass Effect aesthetic.

| Role | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Lattice** | Bus / transport layer | The mesh connecting all nodes |
| **Sentinel** | Per-host VM lifecycle manager | Perimeter enforcer |
| **Scrubber** | Sweeper / archiver | Cleans corrupted/stale state |
| **Arbiter** | Task router / scheduler | Judges priority, allocates resources |
| **Overseer** | Human command interface | Command authority with kill switch |
| **Spectre** | Guest agent inside VM | Autonomous field agent |
| **Ping** | Heartbeat / health signals | Radar sweep, proof-of-life |
| **Armorer** | Image / artifact manager | Prepares loadouts (VM images) |
| **Foundry** | System provisioner / deployer | Fabricates new nodes |
| **Gate** | Cross-cluster bridge | Controlled passage between zones |

## Implementation Notes

### Theme as Config

```toml
[display]
theme = "forerunner"   # "colony_ship", "defense_grid", or custom
```

### Where Theming Applies

- Binary names: `gbe-sentinel`, `gbe-watcher` (always use Forerunner for actual crate names)
- Log prefixes: `[sentinel:host-01]`, `[watcher]`
- CLI output: status displays, health reports
- Config file section names (optional, can alias)

### Where Theming Does NOT Apply

- Crate names (always Forerunner — `gbe-sentinel`, `gbe-watcher`)
- Bus subjects (always `gbe.tasks.*`, `gbe.events.*`)
- State store keys (always `gbe:state:*`)
- API contracts

Crate names are the canonical identity. Theming is a presentation layer only.
